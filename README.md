#### Please click here to access the app: https://namakuto.shinyapps.io/mtcars_mean_calculator_app/

This Shiny calcutor app will plot the means of various mtcar parameters versus the number of cylinders in the car (4, 6 or 8). You will also be able to customize the colour theme of the plot within a `Fill colour of choice:` prompt.

A `Y variable of choice:` prompt will allow you to change the response variable that is plotted.

<sup>[1]</sup>: Any R-language program should run the app files fine, but these instructions are specific to Rstudio.
